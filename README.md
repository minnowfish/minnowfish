 Pomodoro Timer </a></h3>
<p>A pomodoro timer project that is currently ongoing for me to refresh my html and css knowledge. I am also using this project to begin learning javascript. My current plans is to add the basic features of a pomodoro timer before researching into APIs that I could add.</p>
